- Actually Compiles C code and doesn't compile bullshit

- Much better than [Claude's C Compiler](https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler)

- Intellectually Honest: Blatantly steals from, plagiarises and uses GCC But atleast it's honest about it. 

- Appreciates the Thousands of people whoe built [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) over decades.

- Isn't AI Slop
